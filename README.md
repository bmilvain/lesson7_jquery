### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. First thing I learned was the using of the console and applying it to the Preview. That was great to see how things look.
2. Second concept that intrigued me was the ability to animate the text when it moved when you hovered over the headline.
3. Another lesson I learned was copying and pasting is not the same as actually typing the code.
